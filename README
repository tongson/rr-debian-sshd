# For Debian Bookworm

### Check for suspicious log entries

```
rru remotehost sshd:check-log
```

### Upgrade OpenSSH

```
rru remotehost sshd:upgrade
```

### Check the installed OpenSSH sshd for the fixed version.

```
rr remotehost sshd:check-hash
```

#### TIP for multiple hosts

```
for x in remotehost1 remotehost2; do rru remotehost sshd:upgrade; done
```
